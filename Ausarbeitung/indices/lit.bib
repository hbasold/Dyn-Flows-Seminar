abstract ={This note contains two fully polynomial approximation schemes for the
    shortest path problem with an additional constraint. The main difficulty in
    constructing such algorithms arises since no trivial lower and upper bounds on
    the solution value, whose ratio is polynomially bounded, are known.
    In spite of this difficulty, one of the algorithms presented here is strongly
    polynomial. Applications to other problems are also discussed.},
